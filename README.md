# NETPBM Format Image Compression

Instructions on how to use:
This code takes an input of a .ppm or RGB colour image in ASCII (P3) and compresses it. Place the image you want compressed in the "inputImages" folder. The input image needs to have the name "sample.ppm". When you run the code, it will compress the sample file and give you a choice to decompress it. The compressed file is in the compressed folder and the decompressed file is in the decompressed folder.
