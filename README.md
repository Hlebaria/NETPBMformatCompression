# NETPBMformatCompression

Instructions on how to use:
This code takes an input of a .ppm image in ASCII format (P3) and compresses it. Place the image you want compressed in the "inputImages" folder. The input image needs to have the name "sample.ppm". The code gives you a choice to decompress the file. The compressed file is in the compressed folder and the decompressed file is in the decompressed folder.
